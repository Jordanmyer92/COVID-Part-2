Do vaccines actually work?

Group 7 chose to expand on project one, which was an analysis of data gathered by several states on COVID-19.  For project 2 the team will focus one state to give more detailed analysis on COVID-19 and its impacts. The team will give more visualization to help explain the impacts of COVID 19 on the population and take another look at the data to see if the vaccine roll out has had any positive impact on slowing the number of cases.  Please find below the database, formatting, and visualizations we plan to use for project 2.
